Zinf 2.1 for Win32 and Linux:

  freeamp [options] [file 1] [file 2]...

  A lot has changed since version 1.3. In version 2.0 we have an all
  new interface with easily labelled buttons.

  * My Music - Opens a music browser which will hopefully allow you
      to more easily manage your music. The "My Music" dialog allows
      you to edit the current play queue as well as persistant 
      playlists.
  * Options - Opens the preferences dialog, enabling you to control
      many features in Zinf.
  * Files - Allows you to immediately open files located on your
      file system.
  * Download - Opens the download manager.

  Above the button bar are the volume slider on the left and the seek
  slider on the right.

  Below the button bar are the primary audio controls, Previous Song, 
  Play/Pause, Stop, and Next Song.

  The small buttons to the left of the primary audio controls control
  shuffle and repeat modes.
