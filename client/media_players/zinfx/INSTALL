The installation of FreeAmp is fairly straight forward.

Linux
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Preparations:
 
   What you'll need to fully build FreeAmp (note: most, if not all, of the
   following are optional, but major features of FreeAmp will be missing
   if the software packages are not installed.)
       
        nasm + perl: if you want to build with assembly optimzations
	libid3: if you want changes made to mp3 metadata to be written to disk
	GTK+ 1.2.x: _NEEDED_ if you want to have a GUI for FreeAmp
	gdk-pixbuf: used for some optimzations, and if you want to use the 
	            kjofol theme converter.
	freetype: needed if you want the GTK+ GUI to look pretty.

 Building FreeAmp:

   Under Linux you must follow these steps to build the binary:

	1) ./configure
           The configure script should be a fairly familiar thing.  If it
	   fails to successfully complete, you're probably missing some
	   vital component.  It will also warn you of any missing optional
	   components, such as GTK+, and tell you where to obtain the missing
	   software packages.  Run ./configure --help to see the various
	   options you have in compiling FreeAmp.
	
	2) make
           This will build the binary.  If any problems occur here, send an
	   email detailing the errors to info@freeamp.org.

        3) make install 
           This will install the binaries and plugins into /usr/local, or
	   to the directory you specified by running ./configure --prefix=foo
	   
	4) freeamp
	   Run it and enjoy =)
	   
Windows
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Build: See the file README.WIN32 in the main source directory

  Install:   
	In order to build the installer you will need InstallShield
	Pro version 5.0 or later. The InstallShield project file is
	in the install/win32 directory.

	The first thing you need to do is run the Media Build Wizard
	under the Build menu. Choose the package you wish to create
	(FreeAmp 32bit Install, etc.) and click "Next" until it builds.

	Next, compile the installer from the Build menu. This will place
	the install files in:

	install/win32/Media/<Package>/Disk Images/disk1

	you can run the setup.exe file or use the PackageForTheWeb 
	utility to create a self-extracting installer.

  NOTE:
	The InstallShield installer looks for the program files in the 
	base\win32\prj directory so if you want to build an installer
	do not remove the files.
